BotRec (MonkeySee)
======

## What is it?
A simple utilitary for visually recording logs which would get played (interpreted) by a robo-car controlled by an `ATmega16` microcontorller.
This is an academic project. It's written in JavaScript on HTML5's canvas.

## The whole
This project is the recorder part of a record-play system. It is the MonkeySee part of the MonkeySee - MonkeyDo project developed as an assignment project in the "Design with microprocessors" class at Polytechnic University of Bucharest.

## Demo

## Output language:
BotRec outputs in a format that has to be interpreted by the AVR-C program running on the car-robot's microcontroller.
An example of the format:

    (^) 1126
    (v) 321
    (>v) 1483
    (^) 214
    (<^) 860
    (<-) 33
    (-) 1522

### Symbols' meaning:
* `<` - left
* `>` - right
* `^` - forward
* `v` - backward
* `-` - brake

Action symbols are put in brackets.

### A command has two parts:
* _direction_ _part_ (e.g. `(>v)`) - if two symbols are present, the first one always represents the steering
* _duration_ _part_ - the amount of time the command is active measured in *milliseconds*
